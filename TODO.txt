===================================================
Used to maintain requested features or future work.
===================================================

- add documentation about the system properties for exposing JMX from JVM args
	- benefits of not doing it that way

- look into attributes on each of the operation parameters

- look into a setting that secures the server-side connections
	- password files?
	- username/password map?
	- SSL support

- put together some documentation for Spring
	- maybe a test program instead
	- show the bean names
	- show the naming strategy

- add support for the Descriptor information on a class, method, or field basis:
	- defaultValue
	- deprecated
	- enabled
	- units

- have the JMX client be able to access a bean by its class.
	- it would use the annotations to determine the domain and object-name
	- jmxClient.get(Foo.class)

- how about a HTTP proxy server
	- exposes all beans that the server that it is pointed to exposes
