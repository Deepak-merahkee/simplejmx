	- defaultValue
	- deprecated
	- enabled
	- units

- have the JMX client be able to access a bean by its class.
	- it would use the annotations to determine the domain and object-name
	- jmxClient.get(Foo.class)

- how about a HTTP proxy server
	- exposes all beans that the server that it is pointed to exposes
	- combination of a web-client and a jmx_client
